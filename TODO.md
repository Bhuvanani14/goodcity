# Netlify Deployment Conversion Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ Express.js application analyzed
- ✅ Plan approved for conversion to Netlify Functions
- ✅ All Netlify Functions created and configured
- ✅ Database connection updated for MongoDB Atlas
- ✅ Package.json updated with Netlify dependencies
- ✅ README.md updated with deployment guide
- ✅ Environment variables configuration created

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Configuration Setup
- ✅ Create netlify.toml configuration file for build settings and redirects

### 2. Directory Structure
- ✅ Create netlify/functions/ directory structure

### 3. Convert Express Routes to Netlify Functions
- ✅ auth-register.js - User registration endpoint
- ✅ auth-login.js - User login endpoint
- ✅ auth-logout.js - User logout endpoint
- ✅ auth-me.js - Get current user info endpoint
- ✅ issues-get.js - Get all issues endpoint
- ✅ issues-post.js - Create new issue endpoint
- ✅ issues-get-id.js - Get specific issue endpoint
- ✅ issues-put-id.js - Update issue endpoint
- ✅ issues-vote.js - Vote on issue endpoint
- ✅ my-issues.js - Get user's reported issues endpoint
- ✅ admin-stats.js - Admin statistics endpoint

### 4. Database and Utilities
- ✅ Create shared database connection utility for MongoDB Atlas (utils/db.js)

### 5. Package Configuration
- ✅ Update package.json with Netlify-specific scripts and dependencies

### 6. Documentation
- ✅ Create MongoDB Atlas setup instructions
- ✅ Update README.md with Netlify deployment guide
- ✅ Create environment variables configuration guide (.env.example)

### 7. Database Seeding
- ✅ Update seed.js to work with MongoDB Atlas and environment variables

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Set up MongoDB Atlas
- Create MongoDB Atlas account
- Create cluster and database user
- Get connection string
- Whitelist IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0 for development)

### 2. Environment Variables
- Create .env file locally with MONGODB_URI and JWT_SECRET
- Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard for production

### 3. Deploy to Netlify
- Push code to Git repository
- Connect repository to Netlify
- Configure build settings (should auto-detect netlify.toml)
- Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
- Deploy and test

### 4. Testing
- Test locally with Netlify CLI: `npm run netlify`
- Test all functions after deployment
- Verify database connections and authentication

## Notes
- All Express routes have been converted to individual Netlify Functions
- JWT authentication maintained for serverless environment
- Database connection updated to use MongoDB Atlas
- CORS headers configured for all functions
- Static files served directly from Netlify CDN
